							<p><strong>Documents:</strong></p>
							<p>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZJVEP74PIcXi0ZP1P5BepZMxrw011_mv/view?usp=sharing</p>
							<p><strong>Genre (type of document):</strong>Technical Document/lab format </P>
							<p><strong>Audience and purpose of the document:</strong>Techincal people looking to get into home automation, and the programing aspect involved in home automation</p>
							<p>The purpose of the document is to show my capabilities in IOT devices and programming; Proving that I am capable enough to create something practical in the real world using the internet. </P>
							<p><strong>Reason for creating the document as did:</strong>Overall, the document was created to showcase how one can set up home automation using Zigbee devices, and then using python, how one can use the AccuWeather API to get weather information and control the fan accordingly. </p>
							<p><strong>Strengths of document:</strong>The overall strength of the document is the technicality; the document gives the user quality information to start programming with Zigbee devices, which isn't necessarily available only due to many sources want you to download apps to control your devices.  </p>
							<p><strong>Weaknesses of document:</strong>Overall, the disadvantages of the document would be the explanation portion of why we need to download modules and why Zigbee works the way it does, but since this was project was overall to showcase an IOT program using home automation, I believe I met the requirements. </p>
							<p><strong>Post-creation suggestions for change/revisions and why:</strong>Overall for post creation changes, I mentioned it inside the document, but I would want to include multiple ways to automate the fan, such as having a servo to control fan speed and add other internet of things devices. </p>
