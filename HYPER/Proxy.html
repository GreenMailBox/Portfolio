							<p><strong>Genre (type of document):</strong>Report/Implementation </P>
							<p><strong>Audience and purpose of the document:</strong>The Audience is the company where we created the document to show all steps in implementing a proxy server and potential employers to show how we can successfully document actions taken during the implementation of our project. </p>
							<p><strong>Reason for creating the document as did:</strong>We created the document as such so the reader can easily skim/scan to the section they are most interested in, as this is a common practice in a business environment. </p>
							<p><strong>Strengths of document:</strong>The organization and the project outline were overall very well done, showcasing everyones skill in creating a document in a business like scenario. </p>
							<p><strong>Weaknesses of document:</strong>Overall, I believe the paper and excel document showcased everything; the only thing we could have improved on would have been the presentation of the document as we were doing so virtually, and many of us were not used to that scenario. </p>
							<p><strong>Post-creation suggestions for change/revisions and why:</strong>Overall, the PowerPoint/video surrounding the document could be redone to accommodate the paper better. </p>
