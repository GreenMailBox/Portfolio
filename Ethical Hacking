Ethical hacking cheat sheet

Penetration Testing Methodologies:
Reconnaissance: Gather information about the target.
Scanning: Identify open ports and services.
Enumeration: Gather more detailed information about the target.
Gaining Access: Exploit vulnerabilities to gain access to the system.
Maintaining Access: Ensure continued access to the system.
Covering Tracks: Remove traces of intrusion.
Common Penetration Testing Tools:
Nmap: Network scanning and enumeration.
Metasploit: Exploitation framework for testing vulnerabilities.
Burp Suite: Web application testing tool for security assessments.
Wireshark: Network protocol analyzer for capturing and analyzing packets.
Hydra: Password cracking tool for brute-force attacks.
Network Penetration Testing:
Port Scanning: Identify open ports and services.
Vulnerability Scanning: Discover weaknesses in the network.
Exploitation: Use vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access.
Post-Exploitation: Maintain access and gather further information.
Web Application Penetration Testing:
SQL Injection: Exploit SQL vulnerabilities to access or manipulate data.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Inject malicious scripts into web pages.
CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery): Trick users into executing unwanted actions.
Wireless Network Penetration Testing:
WEP/WPA Cracking: Crack Wi-Fi encryption to gain access.
Rogue Access Point Detection: Identify unauthorized access points.
Packet Sniffing: Capture and analyze wireless network traffic.
Reporting and Documentation:
Document findings, vulnerabilities, and recommendations.
Use clear and concise language.
Include evidence and screenshots where applicable.
Ethical and Legal Considerations:
Obtain proper authorization before conducting tests.
Respect privacy and confidentiality.
Adhere to laws and regulations related to penetration testing.
